# Build status

Last updated: 2026-10-09 (world-places + live-flights update). Environment: Windows 11, Node 24.13.1, npm 11.19.1, Next.js 16.4.0, React 19.3.0, zod 4.6.5, vitest 5.0.3, TypeScript 5.9, Capacitor 8.5.3. **No JDK / Android SDK on the build machine.**

## Verified (actually run)

| Check | Result |

| `npx next build` (Turbopack) | succeeds; 21 routes |
| Production server smoke test (`next start`) | `/api/health` ok; `/api/search` Jammu→Kanyakumari returned 30 demo itineraries labelled `demo`; CSP + X-Frame-Options present; app opened in browser |
| `npm audit --omit=dev` | 0 vulnerabilities |
| `npm audit` (incl. dev) | 3 moderate, all in dev-only `@capacitor/cli` → `xcode` → `uuid`; not shipped; no safe non-breaking fix |
| `npx cap add android` | Android project generated; icons/splash generated from `resources/icon.svg` |

What the automated tests cover: connection buffers, ground-transfer insertion, max layover, overnight detection, IST offsets, fare math (quoted vs estimated, unknown components, group totals), ranking correctness (fastest/cheapest are true minima), filters (mode, budget, changes, arrive-by, overnight buses), provider failure/timeout/partial results/error redaction, quote binding, hash/amount/expiry/consent/passenger gates, **duplicate submit (concurrent + retry) hits provider once**, fare change → re-quote with no purchase, timeout → reconciliation (no blind retry), "confirmed without reference" ≠ confirmed, payment webhook without booking ref ≠ confirmed, webhook signature + replay window + event-id replay, cancellation capability gating, cross-user (IDOR) isolation at store and route level, anonymous access rejected, dev-auth impossible in production, prod refuses in-memory store, rate limiting (429), cross-origin and oversized-body rejection, open-redirect/sanitiser/log-redaction, prompt-injection text is inert.

## NOT verified / not done (do not assume these work)

1. **Live auth**: Supabase email/password, email verification, password reset, Google OAuth (web and Android), cookie sessions: code written, **never run against a real Supabase project**. Session handling via `serverClient().auth.getUser()` is untested.
2. **Database**: `supabase/migrations/0001_init.sql` and `supabase/tests/rls_negative.sql` have **not been executed** on any Postgres. RLS "negative tests" in `tests/` exercise the store/route layer only, not RLS itself.
3. **No durable store**: `Store` is implemented in memory only. Production deliberately throws without it. Bookings, quotes and saved trips would not persist. A Postgres/Supabase `Store` adapter must be written and tested before any live booking. Trips/dashboard persistence in production depends on this too.
4. **No live providers**; no booking adapter exists. All itineraries are `DEMO_ONLY`; `POST /api/bookings` returns `BOOKING_NOT_AVAILABLE` for them (tested). The booking engine was tested only with a test double (`tests/helpers.ts`).
5. **Not implemented**: reconciliation cron route, step-up auth/MFA, admin console (intentionally absent), support-request UI/API, return-trip search (`returnDate` is accepted but ignored), passenger-category pricing, Turnstile *widget* in the UI (server verification exists), Upstash and LLM paths (written, untested), consent banner, durable audit export.
6. **Account deletion** will fail for users with booking rows (`ON DELETE RESTRICT`) until an anonymisation step is added (see SECURITY.md).
7. **UI**: no automated accessibility/mobile checks were run (manual semantic HTML, labels, focus styles, reduced-motion only). Not visually reviewed on a phone or in Android.
8. **Android**: no AAB or APK built (no JDK/SDK). Deep-link/OAuth return, App Links (`assetlinks.json`), release signing config: documented, untested. The application ID is the placeholder `com.example.routepilot`.
9. **Deployment**: nothing deployed to Vercel; Play Store: nothing submitted or published.
10. Demo data (timetable, fares, durations) is synthetic. Journey times such as 50 h Delhi→Kanyakumari are illustrative, not real schedules.
11a. **World places (new):** the app can start or end a trip at essentially any city, state/province or airport on Earth: 34,156 cities (population 15,000+) in 252 countries/territories, 2,764 states/regions (each represented by its largest city, because the source has no state centroids), and 9,076 airports/heliports/seaplane bases. Every scheduled airport (about 4,000) is also a node of the route network. A place with no airport of its own is attached to the best airport within 700 km, with an ESTIMATED road leg (about 55 km/h, ~₹12/km) added to time and cost; beyond 700 km it is refused. Data: GeoNames (CC BY 4.0, attribution in the footer) and OurAirports (public domain). **Not included:** towns under 15,000 people (type the nearest city or an airport code), villages, street addresses, ferries/ocean routes, rail stations as places. About 10 airports whose 3-letter code clashes with a curated station code (e.g. MAS, TVC) are omitted from the network.
11b. **Helicopters, private jets, seaplanes:** shown as "price on request" options (never a fare) when both ends have a suitable airport/heliport/seaplane base (helicopters only within 450 km). No availability or price data exists for these; the app links to operator searches. Ferries are not covered.
11c. **Live flight fares (Duffel adapter) are written and unit-tested with simulated responses only**, never against the real API (needs the owner's DUFFEL_ACCESS_TOKEN; Duffel's docs reviewed here do not state what live access requires). When configured, live fares replace demo flights; trains and buses remain demo data. Converted to INR with owner-supplied DUFFEL_FX_RATES (offers in currencies without a rate are skipped). In-app booking through Duffel is NOT built: it needs a fuller passenger model (title, gender, date of birth, email, phone) and payment through Duffel balance. Real-time prices for trains, buses, ferries, helicopters and jets do not exist in this build.
11d. Search speed: about 1-2.5 s per search plus roughly 0.5-1 s one-time data load on a cold serverless start. Route search is pruned (8 onward cities per stop, 3 departure variants per path, nearest large airports as feeders) so unusual detours can be missed. Long-haul direct flights are only generated between major hubs, so most world routes connect through hubs.
11. **Global coverage is synthetic.** 79 cities (31 in India, 48 elsewhere) with real coordinates and fixed standard UTC offsets (no daylight saving). Curated Indian corridors keep hand-written timetables; every other pair is generated from great-circle distance (flights need airports; trains only within India/Europe/East Asia up to a distance cap; buses within a region up to a cap; ultra-long-haul direct flights only between major hubs). Schedules and prices are plausible but not real, fares are in INR, and station/bus-stand names for non-curated cities are generic. Real worldwide coverage needs licensed schedule/fare/places data (see API_INTEGRATIONS.md).
12. Search is pruned for speed: legs must move closer to the destination, only the earliest 2 departures per next-city/mode are explored, and a node budget applies, so it may omit some unusual routes (e.g. deliberate detours).
13. **Voice (mic + read-aloud)** uses the browser Web Speech API (en-IN). Code compiles and the speech-text clean-up is unit-tested, but the microphone, permission prompt, recognition accuracy and spoken output have **not been exercised** (no audio/mic in the build environment): test in Chrome/Edge. Not supported in Firefox; Safari support is partial. **Android app:** speech recognition is generally unavailable inside the Android WebView, so the mic button will be hidden there until a native plugin (e.g. a Capacitor speech-recognition plugin plus the `RECORD_AUDIO` permission and Data-safety disclosure) is added; read-aloud may work. Chat understanding is English only (Hindi speech is not parsed).
14. **Three journey modes** (1 view only, 2 guided manual booking, 3 "plan it for me"). Mode 2 gives per-leg official links (Google Flights search, IRCTC, redBus, or a neutral web search abroad) and a checklist stored only in the browser (self-reported, unverified). Mode 3 auto-selects the best itinerary within a budget but does **not** buy anything: automated booking and UPI payment are not implemented and need provider agreements, a payment aggregator and legal set-up (see AUTOMATED_BOOKING.md). "Use my location" maps coordinates to the nearest city on-device. Not tested with a real browser or device (no browser automation available in this session).
15. **Prices are NOT current.** All fares are demo estimates generated from distance (or hand-written examples). Each leg links to the provider's own site to check the real price. Accurate prices require live provider data.
16. **Payments (PhonePe + PayPal) are implemented but disabled and unproven.** Adapters follow the gateways' published APIs and are tested only with mocked HTTP; never run against the real sandboxes. Gated behind `PAYMENTS_ENABLED=true`, credentials, and a live booking provider (none exists), so no payment can currently be taken. Refund automation, stuck-payment reconciliation, a durable payment store and encryption of temporary passenger data are NOT built (`PAYMENTS.md`). PayPal cannot receive INR on Indian accounts, so it charges a converted foreign-currency amount at an owner-maintained rate. Taking money also needs a registered business/KYC and legal advice.
17. CSP uses `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts (see SECURITY.md).

## External blockers (owner)

- Flight data: Amadeus Self-Service closed 17 Jul 2026; need Enterprise contract or another licensed source.
- IRCTC/trains and redBus/buses: partner agreements required (see `API_INTEGRATIONS.md`).
- Accounts/keys to enter in dashboards: Supabase, Google Cloud OAuth, Vercel, Upstash, Cloudflare Turnstile, optional LLM key, Google Play Console, upload keystore.
- Legal: privacy policy, terms, company details, grievance officer, retention periods, Play declarations.

## Next steps (in order)

1. Install JDK 17 + Android Studio; `npm ci`; set application ID; build with `ANDROID_RELEASE.md`.
2. Create Supabase staging project; apply migration; run `rls_negative.sql`; fix any failures.
3. Implement and test the Postgres `Store`; wire Supabase auth end-to-end; test sign-up/login/Google on web and a device.
4. Fill legal placeholders; add Turnstile widget; configure Upstash; deploy preview to Vercel; run `/api/health` checks.
5. Choose and contract data providers; implement adapter + contract tests; add reconciliation job; only then consider enabling `QUOTE_AND_BOOK`.
