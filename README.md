# RoutePilot AI

Conversational multi-modal journey planner for India (trains + flights + buses in one route), as a Next.js website packaged for Android with Capacitor. Brand is configurable in `src/config/brand.ts`.

> **Honest status:** with no provider credentials the app runs on clearly labelled **demo data**. It never issues tickets or charges money in that mode. Read `BUILD_STATUS.md` before launching.

## Quick start (local)

```bash
node -v            # >= 20.9 (built with 24)
npm install
npm test           # 134 tests
npm run typecheck
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

Production build: `npm run build && npm start`.

No environment variables are needed to try the demo (search, ranking, budget, chat). Accounts need Supabase (see `.env.example`). For local testing of private endpoints you may set `ALLOW_DEV_AUTH=true` (ignored in production) and send `x-dev-user-id: some-id`.

Try: *Lucknow â†’ Goa*, *Delhi â†’ London*, *Jammu â†’ Kanyakumari* (city names or airport codes such as LKO, GOI, LHR work), or chat: `Jammu to Kanyakumari on 20 Dec for 2, under â‚¹8,000, avoid overnight buses`, then `show me the cheapest`, `arrive before 9 AM`, `book option two`.
